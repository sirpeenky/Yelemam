## Hi there 👋 ##

**Yelemam/Yelemam** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

👋 👋 Hi, I’m Yara El-Emam! I’m passionate about data analysis and development, with a focus on expanding my skillset in ETL processes, NoSQL, and machine learning. I'm currently working toward my certification, which I expect to receive in December 2024.

🔍 Projects and Challenges I've Worked On:

   - Telecom Stock Market Analysis Project: Analyzed stock trends and patterns using Python and data analysis libraries (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) to predict market performance.
   - Crowdfunding ETL Project: Currently working on extracting, transforming, and loading crowdfunding data using Python and PostgreSQL.
   
**Completed Challenges**:
   - VBA Challenge: Used VBA scripting to analyze stock market data.
   - Python Data Analysis Challenge: Analyzed company financial records and modernized a small rural town’s vote counting process.
   - Pandas Challenge: Analyzed district-wide standardized test results.
   - API Challenge: Analyzed worldwide weather patterns using API keys and Python.
   - SQL Data Querying Challenge: Created and queried employee tables.
   - SQLAlchemy Challenge: Analyzed and explored climate data.
   - Web Scraping Challenge: Completed a full web-scraping and data analysis project from Mars news articles and Mars weather data using BeautifulSoup and Splinter.
   - NoSQL MongoDB Challenge: Loaded and updated the UK_food database, then analyzed and explored it using MongoDB.
   
💻 My current learning path includes:

Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
Languages: Python, SQL, JavaScript (upcoming)
Machine Learning: Supervised and Unsupervised learning (upcoming)
Big Data: PySpark (upcoming)
Visualization Tools: Tableau, Matplotlib, Geoapify (mapping)


🌟 Fun fact: When I’m not analyzing data, I love baking sweet treats and traveling to new places. I also enjoy organizing events that put a smile on people’s faces and teaching kids, 
  which brings me so much joy!



🌟 I’m excited about further developing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. I’m actively seeking opportunities to apply these skills in real-world projects 
  and challenges. Let’s connect if you’d like to collaborate or explore my work!
